# Weather Mate App

Weather mate is an app made with vanilla Javascript. Created as part of theodinproject.com curriculum. This project was my first introduction to API calls and I used it to create a weather APP which shows data dependent on information supplied by the end user.

For this project I used
- Javascript
- Web Pack
- ES Lint (Standard Javascript Style) 
- Open Weather API
